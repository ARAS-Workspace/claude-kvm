Complete the following multi-step task on the XFCE desktop (1280x720):

## Step 1 — Open the web browser
Click the web browser icon (globe icon) on the bottom taskbar to launch Firefox.

## Step 2 — Navigate to the website
Click the address bar, type www.phantom.tc, and press Enter. Wait for the page to load.

## Step 3 — Scroll down to find the install command
The initial view shows the Phantom logo (ghost in a green shield), the text "PHANTOM", the tagline "YOUR SERVER, YOUR NETWORK, YOUR PRIVACY", and TR/EN language buttons. The install command is NOT visible yet — it is below the fold.

Press PageDown once to scroll down. After scrolling, you will see a section titled "QUICK INSTALL" with a code box containing:
  curl -sSL https://install.phantom.tc | bash

There is a small copy button (clipboard icon) on the right side of the code box.

## Step 4 — Copy the install command
Click the copy button next to the install command to copy it to the clipboard. Alternatively, triple-click the command text to select it, then use Ctrl+C to copy.

## Step 5 — Open a terminal
Open the XFCE Terminal. You can find it on the bottom taskbar (it looks like a dark terminal/console icon) or right-click the desktop and look for "Open Terminal Here" in the context menu.

## Step 6 — Paste and run the command
Click inside the terminal window, paste the command using Ctrl+Shift+V, and press Enter to start the installation.

## Verification
Take a screenshot to confirm the terminal shows the curl command running or its output. The task is complete when the install command has been executed in the terminal.
