## Important Notes

- Before scrolling, click on the page body to ensure it has focus.
- Use cursor_crop after clicking to confirm where the cursor landed.
- If the page has language buttons (TR/EN), click EN first to switch to English content.
- If scroll or pagedown doesn't change the page, try clicking a different area of the page body and retry.
- The install command is below the fold — you must scroll to find it.
- To paste in terminal use Ctrl+Shift+V (not Ctrl+V).
- Verify each major step before moving to the next one.
